                    <p>Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications. By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.
                        Next. js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering and generating static websites. React is a JavaScript library that is traditionally used to build web applications rendered in the client's browser with JavaScript.

                    <p>Next. js is a widely-used framework for building React applications that offer server-side rendering, automatic code-splitting, static exporting options, and easy production builds. It also relieves a lot of the general headaches involved with creating production-ready React applications. <br>
                        Next. js, a frontend JavaSript framework that builds upon React's UI library, aims to reduce JavaScript fatigue by enabling developers to build web applications in a zero-config environment that provides all the tools they need out-of-the-box.</p>
